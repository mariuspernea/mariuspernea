                I am a curious, knowledgeable person and most importantly, a very fast learner. My expertise covers a wide range of areas but I am, however, aware of my limitations in all of them. I realise that even if I do have an extensive knowledge in these fields and I used to excel at some topics, there is always room for improvement.

<br><br>After the first two years of medical school, I have completed my BSc degree in “Medical Physics and Bioengineering” with First-Class Honours as part of my training to become a doctor. This BSc covers a wide range of aspects from mathematics and physics and it has allowed me to extend and gather an in-depth expertise in these fields, learning about concepts that are at a very high academic standard.

<br><br>I think that not only broad experience makes you a great tutor, but also the ability to clearly explain concepts, theorems or principles that you have not met before and that you are not familiar with. My organisational skills, that have proven to be so valuable for me, along with my capability to learn quickly have been pushing me to advance my skills in many fields and I think this is precisely what would make me an excellent tutor.

<br><br>I offer teaching on the following subjects as a tutor:</p>
                <ul id="texttutoring">
                  <li>Maths A-level</li>
                  <li>Maths GCSE</li>
                  <li>Maths Key Stage</li>
                  <li>Physics A-level</li>
                  <li>Physics GCSE</li>
                  <li>Computer Science A-level</li>
                  <li>Computer Science GCSE</li>
                  <li>Programming languages: HTML, CSS, Matlab, Swift</li>
                  <li>Biomedical Admission Test</li>
                  <li>Medical School Interview Preparation</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
          <p id="texttutoring">Here are some reviews:<br>
            <b><i>"I would strongly recommend Marius as a Maths tutor primarily because he is very knowledgeable and a
            very patient person. He is aware of the fact that people learn in different ways and in different
            time frames so he adjusts depending on the student. Additionally, he is a charming and passionate
            person and I found great pleasure in working with him." </i></b>- A-level Maths student
            <br><br>

            <b><i>"As an individual, Marius is one of the few ones gifted with an excellent intellect, problem solving
              capacities, the ability of making rapid connections, robust logic and an outstanding knowledge and
              comprehension of the subjects he teaches. Not to be omitted, all these features are intertwined with a
              pleasant, easy-going personality and an organised conduct, which reflects especially in his punctuality
              and time and tasks management. All of these project upon his performance as a tutor, which is as
              impeccable as successful. As a tutor, Marius managed to put his students back on track and consolidate
              their weaknesses by thoroughly explaining difficult points in an easy-to-understand manner. Not only
              did he manage to make his tutees progress and reach their goals, but also to set higher standards and
              meet accomplishments that they had believed not to be possible. Hence, his approach is an open one and
              he succeeds teaching to all levels of preparation and conveying material in a way that is efficient even
              for those who do not have an inclination towards the subject. I would definitely recommend Marius as a
              Maths tutor!" </i></b>- A-level Maths student
